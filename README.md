# imgproc

I am not familiar with cmake. I had to learn how to make it work with libraries
which took too long.

Then I tried debugging a segfault error I am having.

I will try to complete this and work on the second part tomorrow.


To build
Make a build directory
Inside build run cmake
Run make

cd ..

To run:
ctest Image/test1.png out.png
